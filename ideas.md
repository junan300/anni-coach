  **Design Movement**: Soft Modernism / "Warm Professional"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  - **Empathy First**: Design should feel welcoming and safe, not sterile or corporate.
  - **Clarity & Calm**: Layouts should reduce cognitive load, using ample breathing room.
  - **Trust & Authority**: Professional typography and structured layouts to convey expertise.
  - **Human Connection**: Focus on photography and personal storytelling.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Light Purple (#B4A7D6) - Represents wisdom, creativity, and spiritual healing.
  - **Secondary**: Soft Blue (#6B9BD1) - Evokes trust, calm, and stability.
  - **Backgrounds**: Warm whites and very light lavender tints, avoiding harsh pure white.
  - **Accents**: A deeper violet for text and high-contrast elements to ensure readability.
  - **Intent**: To create a digital space that feels like a sanctuary while maintaining professional credibility.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Moving away from center-aligned blocks. Using split-screen layouts for hero sections and alternating content blocks for services.
  - **Overlapping Elements**: Subtle overlaps between images and text boxes to create depth and connection.
  - **Card-Based Content**: distinct, soft-shadowed cards for services and testimonials to organize information clearly.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Organic Shapes**: Using soft, organic blobs or waves as background elements to break up straight lines.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Generous border-radius on buttons, cards, and images (1rem - 1.5rem) to feel friendly.
  - **Subtle Gradients**: Very soft, pastel gradients in backgrounds to add depth without overwhelming.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Feedback**: Hover states should be slow and smooth (ease-in-out), avoiding sharp or sudden changes.
  - **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Content should gently fade and slide up as the user scrolls, mimicking a journey of discovery.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Slide**: Elements enter with a soft fade and slight upward motion.
  - **Parallax**: Very subtle parallax effect on background shapes to create a sense of floating/lightness.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Playfair Display** (Serif) - Adds a touch of elegance, tradition, and warmth.
  - **Body**: **Lato** or **Nunito** (Sans-serif) - Highly readable, friendly, and modern.
  - **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between section titles, subtitles, and body text using weight and color, not just size.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / "Bold Clarity"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  - **Raw Authenticity**: Stripping away decoration to focus on the core message.
  - **High Contrast**: Using the brand colors in their most saturated forms against stark backgrounds.
  - **Structural Honesty**: Visible grids and borders to show how the content is organized.
  - **Directness**: Large text and clear calls to action.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: A slightly more saturated Purple (#9F8CC0).
  - **Secondary**: A vibrant Sky Blue (#5A8AC0).
  - **Backgrounds**: Stark white or very light grey.
  - **Accents**: Black borders and text for maximum contrast.
  - **Intent**: To cut through the noise and present coaching as a clear, actionable, and transformative process.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Strict Grid**: Visible lines separating sections and content.
  - **Modular Blocks**: Content is chunked into distinct, border-heavy boxes.
  - **Typographic Scale**: Massive headings that act as graphic elements.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: 2px-3px solid borders on cards and buttons.
  - **Hard Shadows**: Drop shadows with no blur (solid offset) to create a "sticker" look.
  - **Monochrome Icons**: Simple, bold line icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Response**: Buttons depress (translate down) on click.
  - **Sharp Hovers**: Instant color swaps on hover (no transition).

  **Animation**:
  - **Snap**: Elements snap into place quickly.
  - **Marquee**: Scrolling text for key phrases or testimonials.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Syne** or **Clash Display** - Unique, bold, and attention-grabbing.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Minimalism / "Light & Air"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  - **Weightlessness**: The design should feel light, airy, and unburdened.
  - **Focus**: Extreme use of whitespace to draw attention to key messages.
  - **Fluidity**: Everything flows into the next without hard stops.
  - **Translucency**: Using glassmorphism to layer content.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Pastel Purple (#Dcd6ed).
  - **Secondary**: Pale Blue (#D2e0f2).
  - **Backgrounds**: White with very subtle, large blurred color orbs.
  - **Accents**: Dark Grey (not black) for text to keep it soft.
  - **Intent**: To reflect the peace and clarity that comes from coaching and therapy.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Axis**: Content flows down a central line but branches out organically.
  - **Floating Elements**: Images and cards don't feel "grounded" but rather suspended in space.
  - **Full-Screen Sections**: Each section takes up significant vertical space to allow for breathing room.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects on navigation and cards.
  - **Blurred Orbs**: Large, out-of-focus colored circles moving slowly in the background.
  - **Thin Lines**: Hairline dividers and button borders.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Everything feels like it's floating in water.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor or follower that adds a magical touch.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float**: Continuous, slow floating animation on images and background elements.
  - **Blur Reveal**: Text un-blurs as it enters the viewport.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Cormorant Garamond** - Delicate, expressive serif.
  - **Body**: **Mulish** - Clean, minimalist sans-serif.
